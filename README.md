# TP9--OS-Scripting
TP9 assignment for my Python class, Langages de Script (a French course that I studied while abroad, at Paris Diderot).

This assignment was practice using the OS module to traverse file trees and perform related OS actions on files.

FILES:

Arbo: 
    Contains a number of JPEG files that are manipulated by this assignment's scripts

test: 
    Space to store files that have been manipulated (so as not to modify Arbo's files too much)

chmod_downtop.py:
    Traverses file directory and changes file permissions with given code
    
du.py:
    Traverses file directory and calculates the total size of all unique files added together
    
ex1.py:
    Traverses file directory, creating list of absolute paths of all JPEG files
    
ex4.py:
    Contains functionality for printing or removing all files matching given name/file size
    
find.py:
    Driver file for ex4.py; performs actions specified by command line arguments on given file tree
    
    
(I apologize for the use of French instead of English; this was French assignment. 
The code should explain itself at least to some degree, though!)
